            <img src="{% static 'images/williamehits.jpg' %}" style="max-width: 400px">
            <p>William E. Hitselberger M.D. (1930-2014) also known as the tumornator, was a neurosurgeon who developed
                innovative
                approaches to skull base tumors. He performed more than 6000 surgeries to remove acoustic neuromas. He
                was a
                pioneer in developing the auditory brainstem implant and he directly, or indirectly, helped train most
                neurotologic surgeons in this country. He made a difference. He also enjoyed a good IPA, and we have
                made a
                great one. </p>

            <h2>THE BEER</h2>
            <p>A crisp, malty Triple IPA brewed with 5 different types of hops. Big citrus and tropical fruit tones
                along
                with intense pine,
                and woodsy aromas. This unfiltered Triple IPA is only brewed a few times a year, and it pairs well with
                sunshine,
                Golden Retrievers and clothes fresh out of the dryer.

                12.5% ABV 100 IBU </p>
