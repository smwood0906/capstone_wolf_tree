# capstone_wolf_tree
This is my capstone project for Bootcamp. It will be a functioning website, built using Django, Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL, for Wolf Tree Brewery of Seal Rock, OR. 

A Beer Finder app will allow the owner to add businesses where his beer is sold, and the user end will allow users to search for beer 
based on their geopgraphical location. This information will be stored in a database, editable by the owner. There will be a blog posting 
function, as well as mailing list functionality through MailChimp. An events calendar, and social media syncing will be on the main page.
